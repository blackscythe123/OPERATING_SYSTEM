# Assignment 6: Shared Memory IPC - C Files

## Compilation and Execution Instructions

### Application 1: Parent-Child Name Conversion
```bash
gcc -o name_converter name_converter.c
./name_converter
```

### Application 2: Chat System
```bash
# Compile both programs
gcc -o server server.c
gcc -o client client.c

# Run server in one terminal
./server

# Run client in another terminal (in a separate terminal window)
./client
```

## File Descriptions

1. **name_converter.c** - Parent-child process communication for uppercase name conversion
2. **server.c** - Chat server program using shared memory
3. **client.c** - Chat client program that connects to the server

## Important Notes

- Make sure to run the server program first before running the client
- Both programs use the same shared memory key generated by ftok()
- The client will fail if server is not running when it tries to connect
- Type "bye" in either client or server to exit the chat application
- All programs include proper error handling and memory cleanup

## System Requirements

- Unix/Linux operating system
- GCC compiler
- POSIX shared memory support
- Required header files: sys/ipc.h, sys/shm.h, sys/wait.h, unistd.h
